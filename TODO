Allow user to pass a named expansion list as an option (will use with Makefiles, where the makefile can generate, e.g. P01,P02,P03,P04)
(done, but *only for a single named expression - this is to do with argparse)

Linked groups, i.e. --trackerfile /results/{1:OpenFace,CppMT}/P01_front.{1:Openface,txt}

Nested groups - i.e. --trackerfile /results/{a:OpenFace,Cppmt}/{p:}_front{a:}
(this should already work - it does; see unit test)
